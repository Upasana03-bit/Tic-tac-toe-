# Tic-tac-toe-
Tic-tac-toe , noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os/“X’y O’sies” (Ireland), is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best play from both players. 
# Tic Tac Toe Game Development using C:
While making a Tic Tac Toe game using C language, it is important to make use of arrays. The Xs and Os are kept in different arrays, and they are passed between several functions in the code to keep track of how the game goes.
# Functions Used :
void go(int n)
void start_game()
void check_draw()
void draw_board()
void player_first()
void put_X_O(char ch, int pos)
void gotoxy (int x, int y)
